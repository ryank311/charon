          <p>
            Caribou provides a fully functioning site immediately, with selectively chosen conventions.</p> 
          <p>
            But the beauty is that when you want to expand and alter this basic setup, nothing gets in your way.</p> 
          <p>
            All the tools are there, but nothing is imposed upon you.</p>
          <p>
            Build exactly what needs to be built with robust and flexible building blocks.
          </p>
          <h1>Visit the Admin</h1>
          <p>
            Caribou comes with an admin for managing not only your content, routing, users and permissions, but also the Models which define what attributes and relationships your content has.</p>
          <p>
            You can find it here: <a href="/_admin/login">caribou admin</a> (user:pass caribou:caribou)
          </p>

          <h1>Create some Pages</h1>
          <p>
            Pages link the routing structure of the site to the controllers and templates that render them.</p>
          <p>
            Controllers are written in <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a>.</p>
          <p>
            Templates by convention use <a href="http://github.com/antler/antlers">Antlers</a> (which we developed out of a mustache base directly from the needs of several projects)</p>
          <p>
            But you can swap it out with whatever you want!
          </p>

          <h1>Create some Models</h1>
          <p>
            If all you need is to render some static templates, you're done.</p>
          <p>
            But most likely there is data.  </p>
          <p>
            What does your site keep track of?  People?  Projects?  Stories?  Videos?</p>
          <p>
            In the admin you can build models of your data and create associations between models.</p>
          <p>
            This way the organization of your data reflects real world relationships, and can adapt to needs as they change.</p>
          <p>
          </p>

          <h1>Add Content</h1>
          <p>
            With your models in place, create some things!</p>
          <p>
            Did you make a Person model with a name and an address and a mugshot?</p>
          <p>
            Add a couple in the admin!
          </p>

          <h1>Visit the API</h1>
          <p>
            Now that you've made some models and content, you can access it all directly from the <a href="/_api/model">built in API</a>:</p>
          <p>
            The scheme is simple:  
            <ul>
              <li>/_api/:model shows all instances of a given model.</li>
              <li>/_api/:model/:id shows a particular instance.</li>
              <li>/_api/:model/:id?include=:association gathers all content associated through :association.</li>
            </ul>
            For example: <a href="/_api/model?include=fields.link&order=id">/_api/model?include=fields.link&order=id</a>
          </p>
